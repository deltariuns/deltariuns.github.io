        <h3>
            In the early 1980s, with the spread of car stereos, the term City Pop came to describe a type of popular music... 
            a breezy, mellow mixture of smooth jazz and album-oriented rock – often with elements of jazz fusion, jazz-funk, 
            or boogie – which appealed to an older and more affluent Japanese audience. Essentially a "mood" or "lifestyle" 
            genre, its themes reflected a life of luxury in a sophisticated urban environment.
